# Letters From Players

## The Messages That Made Me Cry

### From Vietnamese Abroad

*"I'm Vietnamese living in US for 20 years. Playing your game, heard familiar sounds, saw familiar rituals... I cried. I felt home. Thank you."*

### From Student

*"I'm studying game dev. Your journey inspired me to start my own project. If solo dev can do this, I can try."*

### From Elder Vietnamese

*"Tôi 65 tuổi. Lần đầu chơi game. Cháu làm tốt lắm, bảo tồn được văn hóa."*

### From Western Player

*"I knew nothing about Vietnamese culture. Your game taught me and scared me. Beautiful experience."*

## Realization

Game không chỉ là entertainment.

It's:
- Cultural preservation
- Bridge between generations
- Inspiration for others
- Art that moves people

**This impact > any sales number.**
