# Player Impact - Stories from the Community

## The Email

Received an email from a Vietnamese student in Germany.
"I haven't been home in 5 years. Playing your game made me cry because the altar looks exactly like my grandmother's. Thank you for bringing a piece of home to me."

## The Streamer

A streamer played it with his mom.
His mom recognized the folk songs. She started telling him stories about the war, about the old village.
They bonded over a horror game.

## The Meaning

This is why we make games.
Not for money. Not for fame.
For connection.
To make someone, somewhere, feel something.
