# Journey's End... Or Beginning?

## Looking Back

18 tháng trước: Empty Unity scene.
Hôm nay: Game trên Steam, 5,000+ copies sold, community yêu thương.

**Unreal journey.**

## What I Gained

### Skills
- Unity/C# programming
- 3D modeling trong Blender
- Sound design
- Marketing/community management
- Project management

### Confidence
Tôi CÓ THỂ tạo ra điều gì đó từ không có gì.

### Community
Hundreds of supporters, friends, fellow devs.

### Purpose
Tìm được calling: Tạo games về văn hóa Việt.

## What I Lost

- Stability (quit stable freelance)
- Some relationships (less social time)
- Fear (of failure, of judgment)
- Sleep (sometimes 😅)

**Worth it? Absolutely.**

## Gratitude

### To My Family
Tin tưởng khi mọi người nghi ngờ.

### To Community
Support, feedback, encouragement.

### To Players
Cho game cơ hội. Spreading word.

### To Myself
For not giving up khi muốn bỏ cuộc.

## The Real Success

Success không phải 5K copies hay reviews tốt.

**Success là: Tôi đã làm được điều tôi nói tôi sẽ làm.**

From empty idea → shipped product.

From "impossible dream" → reality.

**That's success.**

## Final Reflection

Đọc lại post #10 - "Tâm thư trước khi bắt đầu code".

Message to future self đã được trả lời:

*"Future me, you did it. Game thành công hơn expected. Nhưng quan trọng hơn: you didn't give up. Proud of you."*

## This Is Not The End

Đây là end của development journey này.

Nhưng beginning của career mới.

Beginning của many games to come.

Beginning của Vietnamese game dev movement (hopefully).
