# Journey's End - And A New Beginning

## 50 Posts Later

I started this blog as a way to keep myself accountable.
I didn't expect anyone to read it.
Now, looking back at Post #001, I see a scared, naive boy.
Today, I see a Game Developer.

## The Transformation

The game changed.
But I changed more.
I learned discipline. I learned humility. I learned that I am capable of more than I thought.

## Thank You

Thank you to everyone who followed this journey.
Thank you for the comments, the wishlists, the reviews.
You kept me going when I wanted to quit.

## The End?

This is the last post of "Project Ma Devlog".
But it's not the end of my journey.
I'm opening a new folder.
`New_Project_v0.1`.

**See you in the next game.**

_- Solo Dev, Signing Off._
