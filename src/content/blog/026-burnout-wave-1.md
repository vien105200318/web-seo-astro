# Burnout Wave 1 - Hitting the Wall

## The Crash

For 3 months, I worked 12 hours a day (freelance + game).
Last Tuesday, I opened Unity and just stared at it.
I couldn't click anything. My brain felt like fog.
I felt... disgusted by my own game.

## Symptoms

- Irritability.
- No motivation.
- Physical fatigue.
- "Why am I doing this?" thoughts returned.

## The Cause

**Lack of rest.**
I treated this as a sprint, but it's a marathon.
I cut sleep, cut social life, cut exercise.
The debt came due.

## The Recovery

I forced myself to take 5 days off.
- No Unity.
- No Gamedev YouTube.
- Went back to hometown, visited parents.
- Touched grass (literally).

## The Return

Coming back today.
The disgust is gone. I see the project with fresh eyes.
I see bugs, but I also see potential.

**New Rule**: Sundays are OFF. No exceptions.
