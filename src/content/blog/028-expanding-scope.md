# Expanding Scope - A Dangerous Decision

## The Temptation

With the vertical slice working and good feedback, I got confident.
"Maybe I should add a second village?"
"Maybe add a combat system?"
"Maybe add voice acting?"

## Scope Creep

This is how projects die.
But some expansions are necessary.

## The Decision

**Rejected**:
- Combat (changes genre).
- Second village (too much art).

**Accepted**:
- **Voice Acting**: Adds immense immersion.
- **More Rituals**: 1 is boring, need 3 variations.
- **Extended Story**: From 3 nights to 5 nights.

## The Cost

This adds ~2 months to the timeline.
Launch moved from August to October (Halloween).
Risky? Yes.
Worth it? For quality, yes.

**I am doubling down.**
