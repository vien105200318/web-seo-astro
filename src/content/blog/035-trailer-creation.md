# Trailer Creation - The Art of the Cut

## Structure

1. **Hook (0-5s)**: Intense scare.
2. **Atmosphere (5-20s)**: Slow pans of the village.
3. **Action (20-40s)**: Rituals, running, hiding.
4. **Climax (40-50s)**: Fast cuts, noise.
5. **Title Drop**.

## Music

Used a custom track: Traditional flute mixed with industrial drone.
The contrast is unsettling.

## Editing Software

DaVinci Resolve (Free version is amazing).

## Reception

Posted to YouTube.
"The sound design is crazy."
"Finally a game about Vietnam."
Views: 5,000.
Wishlists spiked.
Marketing works.
