# Voice Acting - Finding the Voices

## Why Voice?

Reading text in horror breaks immersion.
Hearing a whisper in Vietnamese "Cháu ơi..." (Grandchild...) is terrifying.

## Casting

I needed:
1. **Minh (Protagonist)**: Young, anxious.
2. **Grandmother**: Old, raspy, kind but eerie.

Posted on a VN voice acting Facebook group.
Budget: Low.
Passion: High.

## The Recording

Found two amazing students.
Recorded via Discord (they had home studios).

**Direction**:
"Don't sound like reading. Sound like you are trembling."
"Grandma, sound like you are in pain but trying to hide it."

## Implementation

Added the files.
Hearing "Bà ơi, bà đâu rồi?" (Grandma, where are you?) in the dark game...
Chills.
This was the best investment so far.
