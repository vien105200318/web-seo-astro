# Internal Struggle

## The Dark Night of The Soul

It's 3 AM. I'm sitting in front of the GDD screen, scrolling through the 70 pages I just wrote. And suddenly, a question hits me:

**"Who do you think you are to do this?"**

## Imposter Syndrome Attacks

Toxic thoughts begin:

### "I'm Not Good Enough"
- Not an excellent programmer.
- Not a professional artist.
- Don't understand Unity that well.
- Never shipped a game before.

### "Market Doesn't Need This Game"
- Horror games are too saturated.
- Vietnamese people don't play indie games.
- Foreigners don't care about VN culture.
- Even if finished, no one will play.

### "Scope Too Big"
- AAA studios with 100 people still fail.
- Solo dev wanting to make 3D horror?
- How many years? 2? 3? 5?
- What to live on during that time?

## Breaking Point

I open Trello, look at the task list:
- 200+ tasks.
- Haven't written a line of code.
- No 3D models yet.
- Only ideas and... daydreams.

**I delete the entire board. Delete GDD file.**

## 3 Days of Silence

I don't touch the project. Scroll Reddit, watch Netflix, pretend the project doesn't exist.

But something strange: I can't stop thinking about it.

## Turning Point

On the 4th day, I read a comment on r/gamedev:

> "Your first game will suck. Your tenth game will still suck. But if you don't start, you'll never get to game #100 that doesn't suck."

And a quote from Miyamoto:

> "A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad."

## New Decision

I recover the GDD file from Recycle Bin. Reopen Trello.

But this time, a different mindset:

✅ **Accept being a newbie**: Learn while doing.
✅ **Reduce scope**: Focus on vertical slice first.
✅ **No deadline**: Done when done, quality over speed.
✅ **Document journey**: So others learn from my mistakes.
✅ **Enjoy the process**: Result matters less than the journey.

## Lesson

**Imposter syndrome will always be there.** But it's just noise.

**What matters is action.**

Tomorrow, I will start setting up the Unity project. Even if scared. Even if doubting. But I will start.

*"Courage is not the absence of fear, but acting in spite of it."*

**The journey continues.**
