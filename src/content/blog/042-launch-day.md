Refreshed the page.
"Positive (1 review)".
It's my friend. Thanks, bro.

First stranger review.
"Recommended. Short but scary. Good atmosphere."
I cried. I actually cried.

## 06:00 PM

A Vietnamese streamer with 500k subs is playing it.
Chat is going wild.
"Game Viet ha?" (Is this a Viet game?)
"Nhìn sợ vãi" (Looks scary AF).

## Midnight

Sales: 150 copies.
It's not a million. But it's 150 people playing my game.
I opened a beer.
**I did it.**
