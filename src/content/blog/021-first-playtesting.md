# First Playtesting - The Harsh Truth

## The Setup

Invited 3 friends over. Ordered pizza.
"Just play, I won't say anything."
I sat behind them with a notebook.

## The Disaster

**Player 1**: Stuck at the first door for 5 minutes. Didn't know they had to hold the key.
**Player 2**: Got lost in the dark. "Is my monitor off?"
**Player 3**: Laughed at the ghost. "She looks like a potato sack."

## Key Findings

1. **Too Dark**: What looks atmospheric on my calibrated monitor is pitch black on others.
2. **Unclear UI**: The interaction dot is too small.
3. **Pacing**: The intro is too slow. They got bored before the first scare.
4. **Bugs**: One player fell through the floor.

## The Feeling

It hurts.
You spend months building something, thinking it's obvious.
Then you watch someone struggle to open a door.

## The Lesson

**I am not the player.**
I know the code, I know the secrets. They don't.
The game needs to be 50% more intuitive and 20% brighter.

**Back to the drawing board.**
