# Iteration Hell - Fixing What's Broken

## The List

Based on feedback, I have 50 items to fix.

## Lighting Overhaul

- Increased ambient light.
- Added a "brightness slider" in settings (crucial!).
- Added subtle rim lights to important objects so they pop out.

## UI Redesign

- Made the reticle dynamic: Expands when looking at interactables.
- Added text prompts: "Hold [E] to Open" instead of just "Open".
- Added a tutorial note at the start.

## Pacing Fix

- Cut the intro text by half.
- Moved the first scare to minute 3 instead of minute 10.
- Added sound cues to guide players.

## The Grind

This isn't the fun creative part. This is the boring polish part.
Tweaking a value, building, testing. Repeat 100 times.

But the game feels **smoother**. It flows better.
It's less "my project" and more "a product".
