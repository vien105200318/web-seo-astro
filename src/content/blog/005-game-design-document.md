# Game Design Document

## Why Need a GDD?

Being a solo dev doesn't mean working chaotically. I need a clear plan, otherwise I'll get lost along the way.

## Core Gameplay Loop

```
Explore village → Gather clues → Interact with spirits →
Solve puzzles based on folklore → Progress story →
Unlock new area → Repeat
```

## Main Mechanics

### 1. Exploration
- **First-person perspective**: Increases immersion.
- **Limited visibility**: Fog, short-range oil lamp.
- **Environmental storytelling**: Observe to understand the story.
- **Hidden paths**: Discover secret paths via clues.

### 2. Investigation
- **Photo mode**: Take photos with an old film camera.
- **Journal system**: Record deductions.
- **Item examination**: Inspect items closely, read info.
- **Dialogue**: Ask NPCs, remember information.

### 3. Ritual System
**THIS IS THE UNIQUE CORE MECHANIC**

Player must perform folk rituals:
- **Offering to wandering souls**: Place correct items, correct position, correct time.
- **Burning votive paper**: Paper folding mini-game.
- **Lighting incense**: Number and position matter.
- **Chanting**: Rhythm-based input.

**Mistakes can attract aggressive spirits!**

### 4. Spirit Interaction
- **Peaceful spirits**: Give quests, information.
- **Aggressive spirits**: Must pacify or avoid.
- **Detection**: Spirits detect via light, sound, time.

### 5. Stealth & Evasion
No combat! Player is vulnerable:
- **Hide**: Hide in closets, under beds, behind altars.
- **Distraction**: Throw objects, create noise.
- **Prayer beads**: Limited use, temporarily repel spirits.
- **Holding breath**: When spirit is near.

## Progression Systems

### Character
- **No levels**: Progression via story and items.
- **Stamina bar**: Run, crouch, hold breath.
- **Sanity meter**: Encounter many ghosts → lose sanity → hallucinations.

### Items
- **Incense**: Repel weak spirits.
- **Talisman**: Temporary protection.
- **Lantern**: Light source, consumption-based.
- **Camera**: Capture evidence.
- **Prayer beads**: Limited charges.

## Game Structure

**5 Nights System** (inspired by FNAF but different)
- Each night = 1 story chapter.
- Real-time: 11 PM → 1 AM (10 minutes gameplay).
- Different objective each night.
- Survival less important than completing rituals.

## Technical Specs

- **Engine**: Unity (decided after considering UE5).
- **Graphics**: Low-poly but atmospheric.
- **Audio**: Binaural 3D sound (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!).
- **Platform**: PC first, maybe console port later.

## Risks & Concerns

❌ **Are ritual mechanics too complex?**
❌ **Will foreign players understand Vietnamese culture?**
❌ **Is the scope too big for a solo dev?**

GDD is 70 pages done. I'm proud but also... scared. **Can I make this a reality?**
