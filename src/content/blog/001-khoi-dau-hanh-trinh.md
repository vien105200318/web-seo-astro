# The Beginning

It all started on a rainy night in December. I sat alone in my dark room, the screen light projecting onto the wall. A question kept circling in my mind: **"Why hasn't there been a horror game that truly exploits Vietnamese ghost culture?"**

## Inspiration

From a young age, I grew up with folk ghost stories - about "ma da" (water ghosts), wandering souls, and forest spirits deep in the woods. These stories are unlike Western or Japanese horror. They carry a specific fear, tied to the land, to beliefs, to the taboos of Vietnamese villages.

## The Decision

I decided to create a 3D horror game - an experience that not only scares but also evokes deep cultural memories of Vietnamese people. A game where players feel like they are lost in the ghost stories their grandparents used to tell.

But I am just one person. **Solo dev**. No team, no publisher, just passion and an old laptop.

## The Road Ahead

I know this road will be long and arduous. But something inside urges me to start. This is day one - the day I decided to record every step, every thought, every failure, and every success.

**The journey starts here.**
