# Final Polish - The Last 10%

## What is Polish?

It's the difference between "functional" and "good".

## Additions

- **Camera Shake**: Subtle shake when walking, heavy when running.
- **Sound Reverb**: Different reverb zones (Bathroom vs Hall).
- **Menu**: Animated background with rain.
- **Credits**: Added photos of the real-life locations that inspired the game.

## Optimization

Final build size: 2.1 GB.
Memory usage: 1.5 GB.
FPS: Stable 60 on GTX 1050.

## Locked

I zipped the build.
`Project_Ma_v1.0_Final_Real_Final.zip`.
I'm not touching the code anymore.
It's done.
