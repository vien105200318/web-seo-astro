# The Final 10%

## What "Polish" Actually Means

- Transitions smooth
- UI responsive
- Audio balanced perfectly
- Every texture clean
- No rough edges
- Everything FEELS good

## Time Spent

Last 10% of game = 2 tháng.

90% was done. But that last 10% separates "game" from "professional game".

**Worth it. Players notice.**
