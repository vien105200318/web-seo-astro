# Steam Page - It's Official

## The $100 Fee

Paid the Steam Direct fee.
It feels like a commitment ring.

## Capsule Art

I can't draw.
Hired a Vietnamese artist on Fiverr for $50.
Result: A haunting image of the grandmother's altar with a shadow behind.
Perfect.

## Description

Wrote and rewrote the "About This Game".
Focus on:
- Vietnamese culture.
- Atmospheric horror.
- Non-linear story.

## Wishlists

Launched the page.
Day 1: 100 wishlists.
Day 7: 500 wishlists.
It's not viral, but it's a start.
Every wishlist is a person waiting for my work.
No pressure.
