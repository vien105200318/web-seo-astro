# Future Plans - What's Next?

## DLC: "The Forest"

Remember the cut forest level?
I'm bringing it back as a DLC.
New spirit: Ma Rung.
New mechanic: Getting lost (non-euclidean geometry).

## Project 2

I have an idea.
Cyberpunk Saigon.
Too big? Maybe.
But I learned how to cut scope.

## Career

I got a job offer from a studio.
"Senior Unity Dev".
I declined.
I'm staying Indie.
It's hard, but it's mine.
