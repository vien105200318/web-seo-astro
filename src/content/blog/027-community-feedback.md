# Community Feedback - Opening the Door

## The Fear of Sharing

I kept the game secret. "It's not ready."
But marketing needs to start early.

## The First Post

Posted a screenshot of the altar room on:
- Facebook (Vietnam Game Dev Group).
- Twitter (#screenshotsaturday).
- Reddit (r/indiegames).

## The Response

**Facebook**:
- "Wow, looks like my grandma's house."
- "Finally a VN horror game that looks decent."
- "When release?"
- 500 likes!

**Reddit**:
- "Nice atmosphere."
- "Is this Unreal?" (Best compliment ever since it's Unity).

## Validation

It's real now. People know about it.
The positive comments fueled my tank.
The negative ones ("Lighting too dark") were useful.

**I have an audience.**
