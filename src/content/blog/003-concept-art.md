# Building Concept Art

## First Challenge

I'm not a professional artist. My drawing skills are... basic. But I need to visualize the game world before starting to code.

## Tools and Methods

- **Photoshop + Old Wacom tablet**: For quick sketches.
- **Blender**: 3D blocking to test composition.
- **References**: Photos of Vietnamese villages, old temples, graveyards.

## Main Concepts

### 1. Abandoned Village
- Dilapidated thatched houses, torn roofs.
- Thick fog, limited visibility.
- Dim light from oil lamps, red lanterns.
- Old banyan trees, twisted roots.

### 2. Three-Room Ancient House
- Traditional Northern architecture.
- Altar in the center, eerie incense smoke.
- Flickering candlelight, creating strange shadows.
- Old worship paintings, mold stains on walls.

### 3. Graveyard
- Old tombs, moss-covered headstones.
- Willow trees, overgrown weeds.
- Broken incense burners, remnants of paper money.
- Night mist covering everything, suffocating feeling.

## Key Colors

- **Black - Grey**: Main background tone, creating depression.
- **Moldy Green**: Moss, weeds, decay.
- **Deep Red**: Lanterns, incense, blood (subtle).
- **Dim Yellow**: Candlelight, oil lamps, creating fake warmth.

## Mood Board

I created a folder containing hundreds of reference photos:
- Duong Lam ancient village.
- Village communal houses from the French colonial era.
- Tay Phuong Pagoda.
- Old cemeteries in Hanoi.

## Feelings

The more concept art I do, the clearer the world becomes. But I also realize the massive workload ahead. **Alone, do I have enough strength?**

*Doubt starts to creep in...*
