# Blender 3D Modeling - Making the Village

## I am not an Artist

I repeat: I am a coder. But I have no money for custom assets.
So, **Blender Donut Tutorial**, here we go.

## The Asset List

Need to make:
1. Traditional 3-room house (Nha ba gian).
2. Altar (Ban tho).
3. Incense bowl (Bat huong).
4. Oil lamp (Den dau).
5. Bed (Chong tre).

## Modeling Process

### The Altar
- Reference: Photo of my grandma's altar.
- Block out shapes.
- Sculpt details (dragons on legs - failed, used texture instead).
- Texturing: Used photos of wood, added grime and soot.

### The House
- Modular approach.
- Wall piece, pillar piece, roof piece.
- Assembled in Unity.
- Roof tiles (ngoi mui hai) were a nightmare to optimize.

## Texturing

Substance Painter is expensive.
Used **Materialize** (free tool) to generate Normal/Roughness maps from photos.
It looks... decent. "Indie charm", let's call it.

## Result

Imported into Unity.
It doesn't look like AAA. It looks a bit rough.
But it looks **Vietnamese**. The proportions, the style, it's recognizable.
That's all I need.
