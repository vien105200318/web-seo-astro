# Researching Vietnamese Ghosts

## Why Research?

To create a truly authentic Vietnamese horror game, I can't rely on vague knowledge. I need to go deep, to understand every detail of the ghost world in the Vietnamese psyche.

## Types of Ghosts in Vietnamese Culture

### Ma Da (Water Ghost)
Souls of the drowned, wandering to find a replacement. They appear near rivers, lakes, ponds. Characteristics: pale blue skin, soaking wet hair, always dripping water.

### Co Hon (Wandering Souls)
Those who died unjustly, without salvation. Usually appear in the 7th lunar month. They crave worship and remembrance.

### Ma Rung (Forest Ghost / Con Mroi)
Mystical creatures in the deep forests of the Central Highlands. Can shapeshift, lure people off the path. Their calls sound like humans but aren't human.

### Ma Troi (Will-o'-the-wisp / Hungry Ghost)
Starved souls, un-worshipped. Big belly, throat as small as a needle. Wandering at night looking for offerings.

## Important Cultural Elements

- **7th Lunar Month**: Month of ghosts, gates of hell open.
- **Hour of the Horse - Hour of the Rat**: Two transition hours, thin boundary between yin and yang.
- **Offerings**: Incense, votive paper, sticky rice, floating cakes.
- **Taboos**: Calling names at night, whistling near forests, walking through graveyards at midnight.

## Application in Game

I'm starting to visualize:
- **Setting**: A Northern village in the 7th lunar month.
- **Time**: Night, from 11 PM to 1 AM (Hour of the Rat).
- **Mechanic**: Player must avoid calling NPC names, must perform rituals correctly to pass.
- **Atmosphere**: Distant temple bells, smell of incense, thick fog.

**This research opens up a whole universe. I'm excited and also... worried.**
