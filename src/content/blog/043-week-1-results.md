# Week 1 Results - The Numbers

## Sales

- **Units Sold**: 1,200.
- **Gross Revenue**: ~$10,000 (Regional pricing lowers this).
- **Net Revenue (Est)**: ~$6,000 (After Steam cut, taxes).

## Reviews

- **Rating**: Very Positive (92%).
- **Count**: 85 reviews.

## Analysis

Better than I expected.
Most sales from Vietnam (60%), US (15%), Thailand (10%).
The "Vietnamese Horror" niche works.

## ROI

I spent ~10M VND (~$400) on assets.
I spent 9 months of labor.
Financially? I made minimum wage.
Emotionally? I'm a billionaire.
