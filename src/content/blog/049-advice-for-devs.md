# Advice for Aspiring Solo Devs

## 1. Start Small

Smaller than that.
No, even smaller.
Make Pong. Then make Flappy Bird. Then make a 15-minute horror game.

## 2. Consistency > Intensity

Working 2 hours every day is better than 14 hours once a week.
Momentum is everything.

## 3. Finish It

A bad finished game is infinitely better than a perfect unfinished game.
Learn to close projects.

## 4. Take Care of Yourself

You are the most important asset of the studio.
If you break, the game dies.

## 5. Just Do It

Don't wait for "the right time".
Don't wait until you are "good enough".
You get good by doing it.
