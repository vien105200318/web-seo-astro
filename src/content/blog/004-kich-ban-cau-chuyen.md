# Scriptwriting - My Own Ghost Story

## Premise

**"A young journalist returns to his village to investigate the mysterious death of his grandmother. But in the 7th lunar month, the boundary between life and death becomes fragile..."**

## Main Plot

### Act 1: Return to the Village
Player controls Minh, a 28-year-old journalist. His grandmother just passed away under mysterious circumstances. Minh decides to return to the village for the 49-day ritual, but discovers many strange things.

**Hook**: In her will, she left a letter: *"Descendants, do not return in the 7th month. If you have returned, remember 3 things..."*. But Minh returned late - exactly on the 15th of the 7th lunar month.

### Act 2: Mysteries Unfold
- Villagers avoid him, refusing to talk about his grandmother's death.
- Supernatural phenomena begin to occur.
- Minh discovers his grandmother's diary, recording a 100-year-old "curse".
- Wandering souls begin to appear, demanding "blood debts" from ancestors.

### Act 3: The Truth
- Grandmother knew about the curse, sacrificed herself to protect Minh.
- Minh must complete a complex ritual to break the curse.
- **Twist ending**: [kept secret to avoid spoilers]

## Side Characters

1. **Old Sau** - The oldest person in the village, knows many secrets.
2. **Thanh** - Minh's childhood friend, now a shaman.
3. **Miss Nam** - The first wandering soul Minh meets, needs help.
4. **Mrs. Nam** - A neighbor with a grudge against Minh's grandmother.

## Mechanics Combined with Narrative

- **Dialogue Choices**: Affect gathered information.
- **Time**: Must complete quests before the Hour of the Rat each night.
- **Worship**: Incorrect worship can anger spirits.
- **Investigation**: Gather clues from diaries, old photos, elders' words.

## Main Themes

- **Family vs Duty**: Minh torn between running away and facing it.
- **Generational Sin**: Descendants paying for ancestors' debts.
- **Fading Culture**: Younger generation forgetting beliefs, leading to consequences.

## Challenges

Writing a script is harder than I thought. How to:
- ✓ Keep Vietnamese culture authentic.
- ✓ Create psychological fear, not just jumpscares.
- ✓ Have depth, not just a "ghost game".
- ✗ Balance gameplay and storytelling.

**I've rewritten the draft 3 times. Sometimes I want to give up...**
