# Particle Effects - Magic and Dust

## The Missing Spark

The game looked static. It needed movement.

## VFX Graph

Learned Unity VFX Graph. It's powerful.

### 1. Dust Motes
Tiny particles floating in the air, visible in light shafts.
Makes the air feel "thick" and old.

### 2. Incense Smoke
Simulated fluid motion for the smoke. It curls and dissipates realistically.

### 3. Spirit Manifestation
When Miss Nam appears, she doesn't just pop in.
She forms from black mist and falling ash.

## Performance

VFX Graph runs on GPU, so millions of particles = 60 FPS.
Magic.
