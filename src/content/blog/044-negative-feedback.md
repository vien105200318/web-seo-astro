# The 5% Negative Reviews

## Criticism Received

- "Quá ngắn for price" (fair point)
- "Mechanics quá niche" (cultural barrier)
- "Not scary enough" (subjective)
- "Performance issues" (legitimate bug)

## Initial Reaction

Defensive. Want to argue. Ego hurt.

## Mature Response

- Performance bug → fixed trong patch
- Length concern → noted for next project
- Cultural niche → đây là feature, not bug
- Scary subjective → accept diverse tastes

## Lesson

**Can't please everyone. That's normal.**

95%positive là incredible. Focus on that.

Criticism makes you better IF you listen without ego.
