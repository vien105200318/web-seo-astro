# Negative Feedback - Handling Criticism

## The Bad Review

"Walking simulator. Boring. Refunded."
"Too dark, can't see sh*t."
"Puzzles make no sense."

## Initial Reaction

Anger. "You just don't get it!"
Sadness. "Maybe my game is bad."

## Rationalization

I replied to the "Too dark" review.
"Sorry about that. Did you try the brightness slider?"
He changed review to Positive. "Oh, didn't see it. Thanks."

## Lesson

Some criticism is valid.
Some is just taste.
You can't please everyone.
Focus on the 92% who liked it.
