# Pre-Launch Week

## Countdown: 7 Days

Game submitted. Steam reviewing. Nothing to do but wait.

## Thoughts Racing

- Will anyone buy?
- Will reviews be good?
- Did I miss critical bugs?
- Is cultural representation accurate enough?
- Will Vietnamese community support?

## Imposter Syndrome Returns

"18 tháng mất vào project này. What if nobody cares?"

Sleep: 4h/night.

**Most stressful week of entire journey.**
