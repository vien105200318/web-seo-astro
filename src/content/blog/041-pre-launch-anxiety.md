# Pre-Launch Anxiety - The Longest Week

## 7 Days to Launch

I can't sleep.
Every time I close my eyes, I see bugs.
What if the save system breaks?
What if streamers hate it?
What if no one buys it?

## Imposter Syndrome Returns

"It's just a small indie game."
"It's not good enough."
"You are going to embarrass yourself."

## Coping Mechanism

I cleaned my apartment. Twice.
I walked 10km a day.
I re-read the positive beta feedback.

## The Button

Steam backend says: "Release App".
It's greyed out until Oct 31st.
It's staring at me.

**Just breathe.**
