# Texture Painting - PBR and Grime

## Everything Looked Too Clean

My models looked like plastic toys.
Real horror is in the dirt, the rust, the decay.

## Learning Substance Painter

Got a student license.
The workflow:
1. UV Unwrap in Blender (Painful).
2. Bake maps in Substance.
3. Paint layers.

## The "Grime" Layer

Added:
- Dust in crevices.
- Water stains on wood.
- Soot near candles.
- Fingerprints on metal.

## Before vs After

**Before**: A clean wooden table.
**After**: A table that has seen 50 years of rituals, spills, and neglect.

It tells a story without words.
The game visual quality jumped from "Student Project" to "Indie Game".
