# Vertical Slice Complete - Milestone Reached

## We Made It

It's been 3 months since I started.
Today, I built `v0.1_VerticalSlice.exe`.

## What's In It?

- **Playtime**: ~15 minutes.
- **Content**: Intro cutscene, explore house, find key, light incense, meet Miss Nam, end demo.
- **Graphics**: Rough but atmospheric.
- **Sound**: Full ambience and footsteps.
- **Bugs**: Probably many, but no crashes.

## The Walkthrough

I played it from start to finish.
- The menu music kicks in (sad erhu melody).
- The intro text sets the scene.
- Walking into the dark house feels heavy.
- The ritual works.
- The ending leaves a mystery.

## Self-Review

**Good:**
- Atmosphere is thick.
- Sound design carries the game.
- Ritual mechanic is unique.

**Bad:**
- Frame rate drops in the yard.
- Interaction raycast sometimes misses.
- Textures on the bed look ugly.

## What Now?

I sent the build to 5 close friends.
"Be brutal," I said. "Don't be nice."

Waiting for feedback.
I'm exhausted. But I made a game. A playable piece of a game.

**Phase 1 Complete.**
