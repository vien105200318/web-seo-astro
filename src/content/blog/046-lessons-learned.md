# Lessons Learned - What I Would Do Differently

## What Went Right

1. **Scope Management**: Cutting features saved the game.
2. **Atmosphere**: Sound design > Graphics.
3. **Niche**: Vietnamese culture is a unique selling point.

## What Went Wrong

1. **Code Architecture**: It's spaghetti. Adding features now is hard.
2. **Marketing**: Started too late. Should have started day 1.
3. **Health**: I gained 5kg and lost sleep. Not worth it.

## Advice to Past Self

"Trust your gut. The ritual mechanic is good. Don't doubt it."
"Sleep more. The code is better when you are rested."
