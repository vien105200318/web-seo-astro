# Budget and Reality: Making Games When Broke

## The Elephant in the Room

The question everyone avoids asking: **"What do you live on while making games?"**

Time to get real.

## Financial Situation

### Current Income
- Freelance web dev: ~15M VND/month (unstable).
- Savings: ~80M VND (5-6 months buffer).
- Passive income: 0 VND.

### Monthly Expenses
- Rent: 3.5M.
- Food: 3M (local rice shops).
- Transport: 500K (bus).
- Internet: 200K.
- Electricity: 500K.
- Misc: 1M.
**Total: ~9M/month**

## Runway

With 80M savings, spending 9M/month:
**~9 months runway if earning nothing extra.**

## Survival Plan

### Phase 1: Hybrid (Month 1-3)
- **Morning**: Freelance (4h).
- **Afternoon + Evening**: Game dev (6h).
- **Income goal**: 8-10M/month.
- **Game dev**: Slow but stable.

### Phase 2: Evaluate (Month 4)
- Vertical slice done?
- Any traction?
- Decision: Continue or pivot.

### Phase 3: All-in? (Month 5+)
- If feedback good: Reduce freelance, focus game.
- If meh: Keep freelance, game becomes side project.

## Development Costs

### Essential
- **Unity Pro**: NOT NEEDED (Personal free enough).
- **3D assets**: 2-5M (Synty, Kenney, discount bundles).
- **Sound**: 1M (Freesound + some paid packs).
- **Music**: 500K (musician friend, license royalty-free).
- **Software**: 500K (Blender free, Photoshop subscription).
**Total: ~4M**

### Nice-to-have
- **Marketing**: 2M (trailer, presskit, ads).
- **Localization**: 1M (if reaching foreigners).
- **Porting**: 0 (do it myself).

### Total Investment
**~6M for vertical slice.**

## Fundraising Options

### Not Considering
- ❌ Publisher: Too early, no demo.
- ❌ Investor: Indie game = bad ROI.
- ❌ Loan: Dangerous.

### Possible
- ✅ **Kickstarter**: After having polished vertical slice.
- ✅ **Patreon**: Document journey, early access.
- ✅ **Grants**: Viet game dev grants (if any?).

### Likely
- ✅ **Freelance**: Keep the lights on.
- ✅ **Asset flipping**: Sell Unity assets created?
- ✅ **Tutorial content**: YouTube, blog monetization.

## Worst Case Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Out of money after 6 months, game unfinished
→ Find full-time job, game becomes weekend project.

### Scenario 2: Vertical slice sucks
→ Pivot to smaller game or cancel.

### Scenario 3: Family emergency
→ Game pause, family first.

## Best Case Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Vertical slice viral
→ Publisher interest, Kickstarter success.

### Scenario 2: Early Steam access sells
→ Self fund continuation.

### Scenario 3: Win grant/competition
→ Extend runway.

## The Bet I'm Making

**I'm betting 6 months of my life + 6M VND + career risk.**

For:
- A chance to make my dream game.
- Learn game dev deeply.
- Build portfolio.
- Potentially change career.

**Worth it?**

Time will tell. But I don't want to be 30 looking back thinking "What if?".

## Reality Check

- This is privilege: No family to support.
- This is risky: Stats show 90% indie games tank.
- This is selfish: Parents want me to have stable job.

**But this is my dream.**

Tomorrow: Commit first code.

*Deep breath*

**Let's fucking go.**
