# Scope Creep - Fighting the Monster

## The Urge

"What if we added a co-op mode?"
"What if the ghost could talk?"
"What if we had multiple endings?"

## The Reality

I have 2 months left.
Every new feature = new bugs.

## The Knife

I had to cut:
- The "Forest" level (too big).
- The "Possession" mechanic (too complex).
- 2 side characters.

## It Hurts

Cutting content feels like failing.
But a finished small game is better than an unfinished big game.
Focus on the core: The House, The Rituals, The Story.
Everything else is noise.
