# Bug Fixing - The Hydra

## The List

Jira backlog: 142 bugs.

## The Funny Ones

- Ghost gets stuck in the toilet.
- Player can walk through the altar.
- Grandma's photo turns upside down randomly.

## The Critical Ones

- Save file corruption.
- Game freezes if you light incense too fast.
- Falling out of the world.

## The Process

Reproduce -> Isolate -> Fix -> Verify.
Repeat 142 times.

## The Feeling

It's not creative. It's janitorial work.
But cleaning up the code makes the game feel "solid".
Zero crash policy.
