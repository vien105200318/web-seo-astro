# Letter to Myself Before Coding

## 3 AM, Again

This is the last post before I write the first line of code.

## What's Done (Pre-Production)

Looking back at the last 2 months:
- ✓ Researched Vietnamese ghost culture.
- ✓ Wrote 70-page GDD.
- ✓ Created basic concept art.
- ✓ Built story and characters.
- ✓ Chose Unity as engine.
- ✓ Planned vertical slice scope.
- ✓ Calculated budget and timeline.
- ✓ Overcame first crisis.

**No code. No 3D models. Only plans.**

But it's time.

## Why Make This Game?

Leaving this for myself to read years later, to remember why I started:

### 1. Passion for Vietnamese Culture
I want the world to know VN ghost culture is second to none. Ma da, co hon, con mroi - they deserve to be told through modern medium.

### 2. Challenge Myself
I want to know if I have enough endurance to finish a large project. Solo dev = ultimate test of discipline.

### 3. Create Legacy
If successful, this will pave the way for VN indie. If fail, at least I tried.

### 4. Fear of Regret
I fear being 40, sitting in an office, thinking "What if I had tried?".

## What I Fear

Honestly? Many things:

- Fear of failing after 2 years dev.
- Fear of running out of money, having to quit.
- Fear game sucks, everyone hates it.
- Fear not enough skill to realize vision.
- Fear this lonely journey is too heavy.
- Fear family disappointment.
- Fear wasting best years.

**But fear most not trying.**

## Commitment to Myself

From this day forward:

### About Development
- Code at least 4 hours/day.
- Document journey honestly.
- Ask for help when stuck (no toxic pride).
- Iterate fast, fail fast.
- Quality over speed.

### About Health
- Sleep 7 hours (no crunch culture bullshit).
- Exercise 30 min/day.
- Eat properly (not just instant noodles).
- Maintain friendships.

### About Mindset
- Accept there will be bad days.
- Celebrate small wins.
- Detach ego from game.
- Open to criticism.
- Remember the why.

## Defining Success

Success is NOT:
- ❌ Game selling 1 million copies.
- ❌ Being famous.
- ❌ Getting rich.

Success IS:
- ✅ Shipping a complete game (even small).
- ✅ Learning new skills.
- ✅ Creating emotional impact for at least a few people.
- ✅ Proud of what I made.
- ✅ No regrets about trying.

## Message To Future Self

_Hey future me,_

_If reading this when struggling:_

_Remember today. Remember why you started. Fire in chest when deciding to make this game._

_If wanting to quit: It's okay. Not every journey has to end as intended. You tried, that's enough._

_If game flops: Your worth is not tied to game success. You are still you._

_If game succeeds: Don't let it get to your head. Stay humble. Help others._

_Most importantly: Take care of yourself. Health before game._

## The Beginning

Enough.

Enough planning. Enough dreaming. Enough overthinking.

**Now is time to BUILD.**

**Next post will be first code.**

**Next phase: DEVELOPMENT.**

See you on the other side.
