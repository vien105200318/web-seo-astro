# Accessibility - Horror for Everyone

## Why Accessibility?

Horror shouldn't be hard because of bad controls or reading issues.
It should be hard because of ghosts.

## Features Added

1. **Subtitle Size**: Small, Medium, Large.
2. **Closed Captions**: [Door Creaks], [Ghost Wailing]. Crucial for deaf players.
3. **Photosensitivity Mode**: Reduces flashing lights (lightning, glitches).
4. **Hold vs Toggle**: Option for crouching and sprinting.

## Feedback

A colorblind friend tested the puzzles.
"I can't tell the red candle from the green one."
Fixed by adding symbols to the candles.
Design improved for everyone, not just colorblind players.
