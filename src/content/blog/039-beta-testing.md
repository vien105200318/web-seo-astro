# Beta Testing - The Final Exam

## The Discord Beta

Opened a private channel.
Gave keys to 50 active community members.

## The Feedback

- "Scariest game I've played this year."
- "I got lost in Night 3."
- "The ending made me cry."

## The Relief

They liked it.
They actually liked it.
The bugs reported were minor.
The difficulty curve was mostly right.

## Final Tweaks

Adjusted Night 3 difficulty (too hard).
Added more clues for the ending.
Fixed a typo in the credits.

**Gold Master candidate ready.**
