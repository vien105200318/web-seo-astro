# Sound Design - The Sound of Silence

## Audio > Graphics

In horror, audio is 70% of the experience. You can close your eyes, but you can't close your ears.

## Layers of Sound

### 1. Ambience (The Bed)
- Night crickets (recorded real ones in countryside).
- Wind howling through bamboo.
- Distant dog barking (very faint).

### 2. Footsteps (The Player)
- Different sounds for different surfaces: Wood, Dirt, Tile.
- Script checks tag of floor material.
- Added random pitch variation to avoid repetition.

### 3. Events (The Scares)
- Wood creaking in the house.
- Sudden silence (stopping ambience = tension).
- Whispers.

## Binaural Audio

Enabled **Spatial Audio**.
- Sounds have direction.
- If a ghost cries behind you, you hear it behind you.

## The "Toc Toc" Sound

Recorded a gecko (tac ke) sound.
In VN culture, hearing a gecko at night is normal, but also eerie.
Added it as a random event.
Played it back at 3 AM while testing. Scared myself.

**Success.**
