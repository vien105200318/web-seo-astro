# Environmental Storytelling - Walls That Talk

## Show, Don't Tell

Players hate reading long notes.
How to tell the tragedy of the family without text?

## The Details

1. **The Dining Table**: 3 bowls, but one is broken and covered in dust. (Implies a death/conflict).
2. **The Calendar**: Stopped at July 15th (Lunar). (The day everything happened).
3. **The Walls**: Scratch marks near the door. (Someone tried to get out).
4. **The Altar**: Fresh fruit vs rotten fruit. (Someone was here recently).

## Lighting as Guide

Used light to guide attention to these details.
A spotlight on the broken bowl.
A candle near the calendar.

## Player Reaction

In new playtests, players noticed!
"Who broke the bowl?"
"Why is the calendar old?"
They started asking questions. That's engagement.
