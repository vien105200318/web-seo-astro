# Vertical Slice: Survival Strategy

## Lessons from Other Devs

Lurking on r/gamedev, I saw a pattern:

**90% of solo devs fail not because of lack of skill, but because scope is too big.**

They start with "MMORPG like WoW", 3 years later... nothing.

## What is a Vertical Slice?

**Vertical slice = A vertical cut through the entire game.**

Instead of doing 100% features at basic level, do 10% features at polish level.

Example:
- ❌ 10 levels basic.
- ✅ 1 level polished.

## My Vertical Slice Scope

### Target: 15-20 Minutes Gameplay

**Setting**: A first night in the village.
**Mechanics**: Subset of full game.
- Basic movement & interaction.
- 1 ritual mechanic (offering to wandering souls).
- 1 spirit type (peaceful, needs help).
- Simple puzzle based on culture.
- Story introduction.

**Level**: Only ancient house and front yard.
- Living room with altar.
- Bedroom.
- Kitchen.
- Front yard with banyan tree.

### Core Experience

Player must:
1. Explore ancient house.
2. Find clues about grandmother.
3. Meet Miss Nam's spirit.
4. Learn how to worship.
5. Complete first ritual.
6. Unlock first story reveal.

## Why This Approach?

### 1. Proof of Concept
Prove mechanics work, fun to play.

### 2. Learning
Learn everything in small scope before scaling.

### 3. Feedback
Show to others, get feedback early.

### 4. Motivation
Completing something > completing nothing.

### 5. Portfolio
If fail, still have a slice to show.

## Production Plan

**Timeline: 3 Months**

### Month 1: Core Systems
- Character controller.
- Interaction system.
- Basic UI.
- Lighting setup.

### Month 2: Content
- 3D models (house, objects).
- Textures.
- First spirit encounter.
- Ritual mechanic.

### Month 3: Polish
- Sound design.
- Post-processing.
- Bug fixes.
- Playtesting.

## Acceptance Criteria

Vertical slice = DONE when:
- ✓ 15-20 min gameplay.
- ✓ No major bugs.
- ✓ Atmospheric & scary.
- ✓ Tutorial clear.
- ✓ Story hook strong.
- ✓ 5 playtesters give positive feedback.

## After Vertical Slice?

**Option 1**: If feedback good → Continue full game.
**Option 2**: If feedback meh → Pivot/adjust.
**Option 3**: If no interest → Cut loss, learn, move on.

## Psychological Shift

Thinking about "Big 40 hour game" = overwhelming.
Thinking about "15 minute polished experience" = achievable.

**Give yourself permission to start small.**

Tomorrow: Start blocking ancient house in Unity using cubes.

Not fancy. Not beautiful. But it's the **first step.**
