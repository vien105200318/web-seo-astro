# Unity vs Unreal: The Engine War

## Starting Coding... But With What?

After overcoming the crisis, the first problem: **Choosing an engine**.

## Unreal Engine 5

### Pros
✅ **Top-tier Graphics**: Lumen, Nanite - future technology.
✅ **Blueprint**: Visual scripting, easy to prototype.
✅ **Marketplace assets**: High quality.
✅ **Lighting**: Realistic, perfect for atmospheric horror.
✅ **Free**: Only pay % when revenue > $1M (lol, I wish).

### Cons
❌ **Heavy**: My weak PC will die.
❌ **C++**: Harder than C#.
❌ **Build size**: Tens of GB for simple game.
❌ **Learning curve**: Steep as a mountain.
❌ **Overkill**: For my project scope.

## Unity

### Pros
✅ **C#**: I'm already familiar.
✅ **Lighter**: Old laptop can handle it.
✅ **Asset Store**: Many affordable assets.
✅ **Community**: Many Vietnamese tutorials.
✅ **Faster iteration**: Quick build, test, iterate.
✅ **Perfect for indie**: Proven track record (Outlast, Firewatch...).

### Cons
❌ **Graphics**: Not as beautiful as UE5.
❌ **Lighting**: Needs lots of tweaking.
❌ **Reputation**: After pricing scandal (fixed).
❌ **Built-in render pipeline**: Confusing choices (URP, HDRP, Built-in).

## Godot?

Considered it too but:
- Few tutorials for 3D horror.
- Small ecosystem.
- Not mature enough for large project.

## Decision

**UNITY** - For pragmatic reasons:

1. **I know C# already** - Save learning time.
2. **Old laptop can handle it** - Important when broke.
3. **Asset Store** - Can buy assets to compensate for lack of skill.
4. **Version 2022 LTS** - Stable, enough features.

## Technical Stack

After 2 weeks of research:
- **Unity 2022.3 LTS**
- **URP** (Universal Render Pipeline) - Balance performance/quality.
- **Cinemachine** - Camera system.
- **Post Processing** - Atmospheric effects.
- **Timeline** - Cutscenes.
- **TextMeshPro** - UI text.

## What to Learn?

2-month roadmap:
1. Week 1-2: Unity basics, URP setup.
2. Week 3-4: 3D character controller.
3. Week 5-6: Lighting & atmosphere.
4. Week 7-8: Audio system & horror mechanics.

YouTube channels to follow:
- Brackeys (RIP, but archive still gold).
- Code Monkey.
- Blackthornprod.
- Sebastian Lague.

## Install Day

Day of installing Unity for the first time:
- Download: 3.5 GB.
- Install: 12 GB.
- Additional modules: 8 GB.

**Laptop fan running like a jet engine. But ready.**

Opened Unity for the first time, looking at empty scene, pure white.

**This is it. The journey truly starts here.**
