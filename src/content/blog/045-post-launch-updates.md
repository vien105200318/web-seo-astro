# Post-Launch Updates - Support

## Patch 1.1

- Fixed the "Ghost stuck in toilet" bug (finally).
- Added "Ultra Bright" mode for streamers.
- Added Spanish localization (fan contribution).

## Community

The Discord is active.
People are sharing lore theories.
Someone made fan art of Miss Nam.
I put the fan art in the game's main menu as a "Thank You".

## Commitment

I will support this game for 6 more months.
Then, move to the next project.
